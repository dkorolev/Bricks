### Expression Builder

Objectives:

* "Record" expressions that will later be JIT-compiled and differentiated.
* Use the `x[]` variables liberally, allowing to perform mathematical operations and functions over them.
* Keep the syntax clean, use the thread-local singleton for expression compilation, same as the one for the variables.
